# Sticky Sidebar

## About this Application
This application was created to showcase my sticky sidebar functionality I implemented about 2 years ago when I decided investigate how do sticky sidebars work, and I wanted to make my own sticky sidebar.
At that time I had significantly less knowledge, but I managed to do it. Since then, I did not work much on the component and this is the result.

I should improve the code quality when I have enough time.
